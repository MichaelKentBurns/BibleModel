# BibleModel
Data model / database containing complete text of the Bible, Cross References,  Notes and other references

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to contain complete copies of the Bible in various translations.  Allow structured access to the books, chapters, and verses of the entire Bible.  It also contains a massive list of cross references.  It allows me to store notes and other structured and unstructured data about the Bible that I have gleaned from reading and study. 
It is NOT a reader or a study tool per se.  That will be another project.

## Inspiration:
The inspiration for this project is my love for the Scripture.  
The Bible is the most remarkable book ever written.  
I have read the Bible since I started reading as a child. 
I will never exhaust the depths of the riches of this book, no one ever has or ever will.
