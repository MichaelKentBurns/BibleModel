## A business analyst perspective is absolutely essential to use cases and software development.

First take a look at this business analyst's introductory video:

There is a template word document that she provides in this same folder: Use-Case-Template.docx 

Wikipedia has a good page on use cases:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case
However, that page gets into the details of how to do it,  so please don't get bogged down in that yet.
Just understand the mindset that you need.  

As a side reference, this is what Wikipedia says about business analysts.

Note: You are not trying to be a business analyst, but you need to understand their point of view to write a use case.
