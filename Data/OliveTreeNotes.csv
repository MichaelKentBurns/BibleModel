Annotations,Note,,GO 2010 Sunday 1 message,"<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">In 1949, a young student at Wheaton College penned some words in his private journal that expressed the growing passion of his heart.  Seven years later, he would lie dead, along with his four companions, on a small beach in the Amazon jungles of Ecuador, murdered by the head-hunting tribe of natives that outsiders called the Aucas.  The words in his journal were these:</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">“He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep, to gain what he cannot loose.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">What kind of man gives his life in an attempt to reach killers with the Gospel of love, knowing full well that he is risking leaving his wife and child without a husband or father?  Who would do such a thing?  Was Jim Elliot so other worldly, so spiritual, that you and I can’t even identify with him?  Listen to the words that his wife, Elizabeth, wrote in the preface to her biography of her husband, “Shadow of the Almighty.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">“Jim’s aim was to know God.  His course, obedience.  He and the other men with whom he died were hailed as heroes, “martyrs.”  I do not approve.  Nor would they have approved.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Is the distinction between living for Christ and dying for Him, after all, so great?  Is not the second the logical conclusion of the first? “</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I was struck with that thought.  Of course, the Bible teaches that one must lose his life to find it, that one must die to self and live for Christ.  But to actually lay down your life, to die, do I really believe that that would be a logical conclusion of my commitment to live for Christ.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">When rioting broke out last year in a city in East Asia where Grace has placed a team of 9 young people from this church with the mission agency called Pioneers, there were days I would sit in my office and stare at the phone and argue with God about what I should do.  Should I make that call to Pioneers and tell them that we are extracting the team from that city?  Should I pressure Pioneers to make that call?  How long should I wait?  How long <u><b>could</b></u> I wait?  What if they were overrun with the violence and killed?  Could I live with myself if I didn’t make that call?  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">More than once I reached for the phone only to change my mind at the last second.  What makes these kids choose to live in a place like that?  What makes us here at Grace send our children to places like that?  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Over the last six years, since I took the position of Pastor of Global Outreach here at Grace, we, you and I, as a family, we have invested right at </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">$ dollars</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4""> in placing and keeping people like this team, in Turkey, in Greece, in the inner city of Austin, Texas, in the Middle East, and in India, just to name a few. They serve the Hispanic community, the Native Americans, on the Refugee Highway, university students, international students and the homeless. That is how we have chosen to invest some of our wealth.  That’s enough money to      .  Why?  Why would we do that?</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Turn in your Bibles to </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Luke 7:36</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4""> - </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Walk with me into Simon, the Pharisee’s, home.  On that day, Simon has invited a very special guest to dine with him.  Jesus was there.  Now, we don’t know why Simon had invited him.  We don’t know if it was part of a strategy by the Jews to find a way to discredit Jesus, or if Simon was truly curious, or if he was motivated by personal status, or what.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">But as we enter the room, we see the men all reclined around Simon’s table sharing a meal together and exchanging polite conversation with one another.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Out of nowhere, a woman appeared at the door to the dinning area. She took a hesitant step into the room and looked around.  As she became the center of attention and all conversation ceased, she felt the death sentence fall on her head.  This was an affront to Simon that would not go unpunished. As she looked up, she was met by the twinkle of anticipation in the eyes of the man she had come to see.  Jesus waited quietly never taking his eyes off of the new arrival. Now her resolve took over.  No longer self-conscious, totally focused on Jesus, and feeling the emotions begin to surge through her she quietly walked to where he was reclined. She knelt down at his feet, the tears now freely flowing down her face, and gently removed his sandals.  Her tears fell on his dusty feet, and as she wept she took her loose hair and began to wipe his feet clean and dry them.  The only sound in the room was her sobs. Then she took out an alabaster flask of perfumed oil, she broke the bottle open and she poured it liberally over his feet, filling the whole house with the sweet aroma.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Simon was indignant.  Verse 39 says, “Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.”</font><font face=""Verdana"" size=""1""><b> </b></font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Jesus eyes caught Simon’s and he said, “Simon, I’ve got something to say to you.  A creditor had two guys who owed him but couldn’t pay.  One owed him fifty dollars, the other owed five thousand dollars.  So the creditor freely forgave them both.  Which one of them would love him more.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Simon said, “Well, I suppose the one who was forgiven more would love more.”  Jesus said, “You have judged rightly.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Now, lets take a break from the story and ask ourselves, what was the difference between Simon and this prostitute whose name we don’t even know?  Was it that one had sinned a whole bunch, and the other had just sinned a little bit?  Or maybe the difference was the kind of sin they had committed.  After all, isn’t prostitution much worse than, say, pride?  No.  I don’t think so.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">The difference between the two was not quality or quantity.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">The difference between them was their perception of their sin.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">The woman had looked herself in the mirror and had freely admitted that she was so indebted to God, that there was no way she could ever pay her way out.  She had sinned much.  She knew it and she was resigned to her fate.  In fact, she probably thought this was the last day of her life.  She most likely assumed that what waited her for this unthinkable interruption in the house of this Pharisee was death by stoning.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Simon, on the other hand, had looked in the mirror and said, “I’m a pretty good guy, and thank you Lord that I am not like other men.  I tithe, I fast, I pray, what’s not to like?”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Do you see that?  It is the perception that naturally leads to the response of each character.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Perception = response</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">This woman had sinned much, true enough.  But she was willing to look at herself in a mirror called “truth”.  By this point she had given up on making excuses and on blaming others.  She would die, but not without letting Jesus know how she felt about him.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Simon had looked in a “carnival” mirror.  Not one of those that distorts your body.  No, no.  This carnival mirror is self-created from the lies he had listened to form the culture around him and his own sinful heart.  These mirrors only shows us at our very best.  And because he had bought into the lie that the mirror was showing him, he was totally self-deceived.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">How we see ourselves directly affects how we love and serve God.</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">  A true mirror will always lead to a heart of gratitude and a life of service.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">A carnival mirror leads to taking things for granted, even God.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">The degree to which you agree with God about who you really are, to that degree will you worship and serve Him.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Either you will look into the mirror of truth, and you will bow in worship and get up to serve, or the “carnival” mirror will make you look good in your own eyes and make God look common.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Mirror of Truth = worship + service</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Carnival mirror = I’m lookin’ good + God look’s common</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Look how Jesus assesses this response from Simon starting in chapter 7 verse 44.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4""><sup>44</sup> Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. <sup>45</sup> You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time she came in. <sup>46</sup> You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil. <sup>47</sup> Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.” 
<sup>48</sup> Then He said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 
<sup>49</sup> And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” 
<sup>50</sup> Then He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I can only imagine the stunned look on her face.  I can see her mouth drop open and tears pool in her eyes once again, this time it wasn’t tears of repentance, it was a tears of inexpressible joy.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">She had come into Jesus presence holding out an empty thimble hoping against hope for a comforting word, some encouragement perhaps before she died.  Jesus opened the flood gates of heaven, and poured out on her a waterfall of mercy and grace.  </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Sins forgiven?  Saved??  Are you kidding me!!!! </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4""> She would actually walk out of Simon’s house and not face death for her intrusion.  She would walk out forgiven.  Now when she looked in the mirror of truth, she would see a new woman, a woman saved by Jesus grace and mercy.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I’m betting that this woman was never the same.  I’m betting that she never got over those words, </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">forgiven and saved</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">.  I’m betting that she lived her life compelled out of the incredible overflow of God’s love for her expressed in Christ Jesus.  I could see her sharing that love everywhere she went from that day on, across her street and around the world, she would go where Jesus led her.  If asked, she would go to a remote city in East Asia.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">She had exchanged what she could not keep, her very life, for what she could never lose, forgiveness and a new life.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Do you suppose that this might be why Jim Elliot died on a landing strip in Ecuador or why our sons and daughters end up in East Asia?  Are these young people BIG sinners?  You bet they are!!  You know how I know that?  Because we are all BIG, HUGE sinners, that’s how. They are huge sinners who have been forgiven much and so, they love much.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">It’s all about perception.  It’s about the mirror you choose to look in.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">At Grace, we don’t do Global Outreach because we love God.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">We do Global Outreach for the love <u>from</u> God</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">It hasn’t always been that way.  Not here at Grace. Not in my life.  It usually takes an act of God’s mercy to get our attention enough to realize that we are using a “carnival” mirror and believing it to be true.  God has graciously smashed several carnival mirrors that I have allowed to deceive me.  Every time it happened I have my spiritual breath knocked out of me, but Jesus always helped me to my knees and whispered to me, “learn from me for I am humble and meek and you will find rest for your soul.”  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">What mirror are you looking at yourself in?</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">There was a time when the Apostle Paul, still known as Saul, was looking at his reflection in a “carnival” mirror.  Much later in his life, he would look back on those days and reminisce about that image of himself.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">In Philippians 3:4-6 he says, “I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so: <sup>5</sup> circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee; <sup>6</sup> concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">What would drive this same man, to repeatedly subject himself to mistreatments like stoning and beatings and ship wrecks and prison for the sake of the gospel?  What would bring him from thinking he was God’s greatest gift to mankind to saying something like, </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">“When I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, for I am compelled to preach,” in I Corinthians 9:16.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I’m sure Paul had a variety of motivations for what he did.  We are complex creatures motivated by a lot of things.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">But I think there is a foundation based on a life experience for this dramatic change.  I think it happened one day when Saul, full of self righteous indignation, gripping in his hand an order given to him by the Jewish Sanhedrine, fuming with anger over what he perceived to be the perversion of all that he believed and lived for, these upstart Jesus followers, found himself flat on his back, knocked from his horse, staring up at a vision of the risen Christ.  The Christ spoke, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me.” In utter astonishment, he asked, “Lord, who are you?”  “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.”  In that second, Saul’s death sentence was signed and sealed. Trembling and astonished, Saul, soon to be Paul, asked, “Lord, what do YOU want me to do?”  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Now, we might think that an encounter with Jesus like that would provide life long motivation for any of us.  But I don’t think that the encounter itself is what compelled Paul.  I think what compelled this man was the fact that after this experience, </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">he was still alive!!!</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">  This self-described chief of all sinners, this persecutor of the church, this murderer of saints, was still alive!!!  How could this be?  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">“I am still alive!  No, more than that, I’m brand newly born.  Where I deserve death, I have life.  More than that, I have been counted worthy to carry this Gospel to the gentiles.  What is this waterfall of grace that I am standing under?  My eyes were blinded and I was expecting annihilation.  Instead, God showers me with his mercy, his love, his grace.”  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">So, he would go on to say in Philippians 3:7 and 8</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4""><sup>7”</sup>But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. <sup>8</sup> Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Paul was motivated, compelled, driven by the absolute overflow of God’s love and grace that he woke to every day of his life after his Damascus road encounter.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">My dear family, this is what aught to compel us as well.  At Grace, we do Global Outreach for the love from God.  I trust that we as a body, and each one of us as individuals, are not deluded into thinking that we are gaining brownie points with God through missions or any other form of service, nor that we are saving the world, nor that we are hastening the second coming of Christ.  I trust that, like the woman who cried on Jesus feet, like Paul who celebrated life knowing he should be dead, we are acutely aware of the depths of our own rebellion against the Lord.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">It doesn’t always take getting knocked off a horse to come to this realization, but it almost always takes something very like that.  At some point, if you haven’t yet, you will find yourself flat on your back looking up at the risen Christ.  What is your response? </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I trust that you, like Paul, will find yourself eternally grateful that, while we cowered in a corner, Jesus reached down with his life, death and resurrection, and poured out a flood of cleansing grace and mercy over our retched and useless lives.  We are born again into newness of life, made co-participators of the divine nature, baptized into Christ’s body, and indwelt by the Holy Spirit.  How can that not compel us to be the best that we can be and give the best that we are in a love offering to this amazing God?  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Remember that phone call I was struggling over making to extract our team from the troubled East Asia city?</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I realized I didn’t make that phone call to Pioneers, because those young people that are out there don’t belong to me.  They were released to God. </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">They are exchanging that which they cannot keep, for that which they cannot lose.</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">  How could I take that away from them?  There is no sacrifice in that.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Are you making that exchange with your choices?</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Don’t settle for your image in a carnival mirror.  Please don’t.  It might make you look good, but it is a lie from the pit.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Look into the mirror of truth that is the person and word of Jesus Christ.  Be compelled with the wonder that </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">you are still alive</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">. You shouldn’t be, you know.  You really shouldn’t.  But if you can feel the waterfall of God’s mercy and grace cascading down on you, then I think you will find a way to celebrate that on a world stage.  You will find a way to involve yourself in God’s purposes for the nations. That road of service, whatever it looks like, whether it is praying, or giving or going, will be driven by many things, but primarily it will be driven by the love from God.</font>",,,,2011-01-23T09:32:00-05:00,2011-03-10T08:33:44-05:00,""

Annotations,Note,,GO 2010 Sunday 1 message,"<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">In 1949, a young student at Wheaton College penned some words in his private journal that expressed the growing passion of his heart.  Seven years later, he would lie dead, along with his four companions, on a small beach in the Amazon jungles of Ecuador, murdered by the head-hunting tribe of natives that outsiders called the Aucas.  The words in his journal were these:</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">“He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep, to gain what he cannot loose.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">What kind of man gives his life in an attempt to reach killers with the Gospel of love, knowing full well that he is risking leaving his wife and child without a husband or father?  Who would do such a thing?  Was Jim Elliot so other worldly, so spiritual, that you and I can’t even identify with him?  Listen to the words that his wife, Elizabeth, wrote in the preface to her biography of her husband, “Shadow of the Almighty.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">“Jim’s aim was to know God.  His course, obedience.  He and the other men with whom he died were hailed as heroes, “martyrs.”  I do not approve.  Nor would they have approved.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Is the distinction between living for Christ and dying for Him, after all, so great?  Is not the second the logical conclusion of the first? “</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I was struck with that thought.  Of course, the Bible teaches that one must lose his life to find it, that one must die to self and live for Christ.  But to actually lay down your life, to die, do I really believe that that would be a logical conclusion of my commitment to live for Christ.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">When rioting broke out last year in a city in East Asia where Grace has placed a team of 9 young people from this church with the mission agency called Pioneers, there were days I would sit in my office and stare at the phone and argue with God about what I should do.  Should I make that call to Pioneers and tell them that we are extracting the team from that city?  Should I pressure Pioneers to make that call?  How long should I wait?  How long <u><b>could</b></u> I wait?  What if they were overrun with the violence and killed?  Could I live with myself if I didn’t make that call?  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">More than once I reached for the phone only to change my mind at the last second.  What makes these kids choose to live in a place like that?  What makes us here at Grace send our children to places like that?  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Over the last six years, since I took the position of Pastor of Global Outreach here at Grace, we, you and I, as a family, we have invested right at </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">$ dollars</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4""> in placing and keeping people like this team, in Turkey, in Greece, in the inner city of Austin, Texas, in the Middle East, and in India, just to name a few. They serve the Hispanic community, the Native Americans, on the Refugee Highway, university students, international students and the homeless. That is how we have chosen to invest some of our wealth.  That’s enough money to      .  Why?  Why would we do that?</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Turn in your Bibles to </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Luke 7:36</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4""> - </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Walk with me into Simon, the Pharisee’s, home.  On that day, Simon has invited a very special guest to dine with him.  Jesus was there.  Now, we don’t know why Simon had invited him.  We don’t know if it was part of a strategy by the Jews to find a way to discredit Jesus, or if Simon was truly curious, or if he was motivated by personal status, or what.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">But as we enter the room, we see the men all reclined around Simon’s table sharing a meal together and exchanging polite conversation with one another.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Out of nowhere, a woman appeared at the door to the dinning area. She took a hesitant step into the room and looked around.  As she became the center of attention and all conversation ceased, she felt the death sentence fall on her head.  This was an affront to Simon that would not go unpunished. As she looked up, she was met by the twinkle of anticipation in the eyes of the man she had come to see.  Jesus waited quietly never taking his eyes off of the new arrival. Now her resolve took over.  No longer self-conscious, totally focused on Jesus, and feeling the emotions begin to surge through her she quietly walked to where he was reclined. She knelt down at his feet, the tears now freely flowing down her face, and gently removed his sandals.  Her tears fell on his dusty feet, and as she wept she took her loose hair and began to wipe his feet clean and dry them.  The only sound in the room was her sobs. Then she took out an alabaster flask of perfumed oil, she broke the bottle open and she poured it liberally over his feet, filling the whole house with the sweet aroma.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Simon was indignant.  Verse 39 says, “Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.”</font><font face=""Verdana"" size=""1""><b> </b></font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Jesus eyes caught Simon’s and he said, “Simon, I’ve got something to say to you.  A creditor had two guys who owed him but couldn’t pay.  One owed him fifty dollars, the other owed five thousand dollars.  So the creditor freely forgave them both.  Which one of them would love him more.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Simon said, “Well, I suppose the one who was forgiven more would love more.”  Jesus said, “You have judged rightly.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Now, lets take a break from the story and ask ourselves, what was the difference between Simon and this prostitute whose name we don’t even know?  Was it that one had sinned a whole bunch, and the other had just sinned a little bit?  Or maybe the difference was the kind of sin they had committed.  After all, isn’t prostitution much worse than, say, pride?  No.  I don’t think so.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">The difference between the two was not quality or quantity.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">The difference between them was their perception of their sin.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">The woman had looked herself in the mirror and had freely admitted that she was so indebted to God, that there was no way she could ever pay her way out.  She had sinned much.  She knew it and she was resigned to her fate.  In fact, she probably thought this was the last day of her life.  She most likely assumed that what waited her for this unthinkable interruption in the house of this Pharisee was death by stoning.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Simon, on the other hand, had looked in the mirror and said, “I’m a pretty good guy, and thank you Lord that I am not like other men.  I tithe, I fast, I pray, what’s not to like?”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Do you see that?  It is the perception that naturally leads to the response of each character.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Perception = response</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">This woman had sinned much, true enough.  But she was willing to look at herself in a mirror called “truth”.  By this point she had given up on making excuses and on blaming others.  She would die, but not without letting Jesus know how she felt about him.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Simon had looked in a “carnival” mirror.  Not one of those that distorts your body.  No, no.  This carnival mirror is self-created from the lies he had listened to form the culture around him and his own sinful heart.  These mirrors only shows us at our very best.  And because he had bought into the lie that the mirror was showing him, he was totally self-deceived.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">How we see ourselves directly affects how we love and serve God.</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">  A true mirror will always lead to a heart of gratitude and a life of service.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">A carnival mirror leads to taking things for granted, even God.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">The degree to which you agree with God about who you really are, to that degree will you worship and serve Him.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Either you will look into the mirror of truth, and you will bow in worship and get up to serve, or the “carnival” mirror will make you look good in your own eyes and make God look common.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Mirror of Truth = worship + service</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Carnival mirror = I’m lookin’ good + God look’s common</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Look how Jesus assesses this response from Simon starting in chapter 7 verse 44.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4""><sup>44</sup> Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. <sup>45</sup> You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time she came in. <sup>46</sup> You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil. <sup>47</sup> Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.” 
<sup>48</sup> Then He said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 
<sup>49</sup> And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” 
<sup>50</sup> Then He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I can only imagine the stunned look on her face.  I can see her mouth drop open and tears pool in her eyes once again, this time it wasn’t tears of repentance, it was a tears of inexpressible joy.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">She had come into Jesus presence holding out an empty thimble hoping against hope for a comforting word, some encouragement perhaps before she died.  Jesus opened the flood gates of heaven, and poured out on her a waterfall of mercy and grace.  </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">Sins forgiven?  Saved??  Are you kidding me!!!! </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4""> She would actually walk out of Simon’s house and not face death for her intrusion.  She would walk out forgiven.  Now when she looked in the mirror of truth, she would see a new woman, a woman saved by Jesus grace and mercy.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I’m betting that this woman was never the same.  I’m betting that she never got over those words, </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">forgiven and saved</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">.  I’m betting that she lived her life compelled out of the incredible overflow of God’s love for her expressed in Christ Jesus.  I could see her sharing that love everywhere she went from that day on, across her street and around the world, she would go where Jesus led her.  If asked, she would go to a remote city in East Asia.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">She had exchanged what she could not keep, her very life, for what she could never lose, forgiveness and a new life.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Do you suppose that this might be why Jim Elliot died on a landing strip in Ecuador or why our sons and daughters end up in East Asia?  Are these young people BIG sinners?  You bet they are!!  You know how I know that?  Because we are all BIG, HUGE sinners, that’s how. They are huge sinners who have been forgiven much and so, they love much.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">It’s all about perception.  It’s about the mirror you choose to look in.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">At Grace, we don’t do Global Outreach because we love God.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">We do Global Outreach for the love <u>from</u> God</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">It hasn’t always been that way.  Not here at Grace. Not in my life.  It usually takes an act of God’s mercy to get our attention enough to realize that we are using a “carnival” mirror and believing it to be true.  God has graciously smashed several carnival mirrors that I have allowed to deceive me.  Every time it happened I have my spiritual breath knocked out of me, but Jesus always helped me to my knees and whispered to me, “learn from me for I am humble and meek and you will find rest for your soul.”  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">What mirror are you looking at yourself in?</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">There was a time when the Apostle Paul, still known as Saul, was looking at his reflection in a “carnival” mirror.  Much later in his life, he would look back on those days and reminisce about that image of himself.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">In Philippians 3:4-6 he says, “I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so: <sup>5</sup> circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee; <sup>6</sup> concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">What would drive this same man, to repeatedly subject himself to mistreatments like stoning and beatings and ship wrecks and prison for the sake of the gospel?  What would bring him from thinking he was God’s greatest gift to mankind to saying something like, </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">“When I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, for I am compelled to preach,” in I Corinthians 9:16.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I’m sure Paul had a variety of motivations for what he did.  We are complex creatures motivated by a lot of things.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">But I think there is a foundation based on a life experience for this dramatic change.  I think it happened one day when Saul, full of self righteous indignation, gripping in his hand an order given to him by the Jewish Sanhedrine, fuming with anger over what he perceived to be the perversion of all that he believed and lived for, these upstart Jesus followers, found himself flat on his back, knocked from his horse, staring up at a vision of the risen Christ.  The Christ spoke, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me.” In utter astonishment, he asked, “Lord, who are you?”  “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.”  In that second, Saul’s death sentence was signed and sealed. Trembling and astonished, Saul, soon to be Paul, asked, “Lord, what do YOU want me to do?”  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Now, we might think that an encounter with Jesus like that would provide life long motivation for any of us.  But I don’t think that the encounter itself is what compelled Paul.  I think what compelled this man was the fact that after this experience, </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">he was still alive!!!</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">  This self-described chief of all sinners, this persecutor of the church, this murderer of saints, was still alive!!!  How could this be?  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">“I am still alive!  No, more than that, I’m brand newly born.  Where I deserve death, I have life.  More than that, I have been counted worthy to carry this Gospel to the gentiles.  What is this waterfall of grace that I am standing under?  My eyes were blinded and I was expecting annihilation.  Instead, God showers me with his mercy, his love, his grace.”  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">So, he would go on to say in Philippians 3:7 and 8</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4""><sup>7”</sup>But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. <sup>8</sup> Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">.”</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Paul was motivated, compelled, driven by the absolute overflow of God’s love and grace that he woke to every day of his life after his Damascus road encounter.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">My dear family, this is what aught to compel us as well.  At Grace, we do Global Outreach for the love from God.  I trust that we as a body, and each one of us as individuals, are not deluded into thinking that we are gaining brownie points with God through missions or any other form of service, nor that we are saving the world, nor that we are hastening the second coming of Christ.  I trust that, like the woman who cried on Jesus feet, like Paul who celebrated life knowing he should be dead, we are acutely aware of the depths of our own rebellion against the Lord.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">It doesn’t always take getting knocked off a horse to come to this realization, but it almost always takes something very like that.  At some point, if you haven’t yet, you will find yourself flat on your back looking up at the risen Christ.  What is your response? </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I trust that you, like Paul, will find yourself eternally grateful that, while we cowered in a corner, Jesus reached down with his life, death and resurrection, and poured out a flood of cleansing grace and mercy over our retched and useless lives.  We are born again into newness of life, made co-participators of the divine nature, baptized into Christ’s body, and indwelt by the Holy Spirit.  How can that not compel us to be the best that we can be and give the best that we are in a love offering to this amazing God?  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Remember that phone call I was struggling over making to extract our team from the troubled East Asia city?</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">I realized I didn’t make that phone call to Pioneers, because those young people that are out there don’t belong to me.  They were released to God. </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">They are exchanging that which they cannot keep, for that which they cannot lose.</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">  How could I take that away from them?  There is no sacrifice in that.  </font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Are you making that exchange with your choices?</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Don’t settle for your image in a carnival mirror.  Please don’t.  It might make you look good, but it is a lie from the pit.</font>
<font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">Look into the mirror of truth that is the person and word of Jesus Christ.  Be compelled with the wonder that </font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"" color=""#ff0000"">you are still alive</font><font face=""Comic Sans MS"" size=""4"">. You shouldn’t be, you know.  You really shouldn’t.  But if you can feel the waterfall of God’s mercy and grace cascading down on you, then I think you will find a way to celebrate that on a world stage.  You will find a way to involve yourself in God’s purposes for the nations. That road of service, whatever it looks like, whether it is praying, or giving or going, will be driven by many things, but primarily it will be driven by the love from God.</font>",,,,2011-01-18T15:49:39-05:00,2011-01-18T15:49:40-05:00,""

But here is the central point in this conversation: To be afraid to meditate properly, because some others do it inappropriately (or even dangerously), is like being afraid to use the telephone in case you might get a wrong number. Meditation is an essential part of a balanced Christian life. “Draw near to God and He will draw near to you” (James 4:8). It’s a promise.2

https://bible.org/article/biblical-meditation

(4) Transformation—It is designed to transform and change our lives. This would apply to all the above (Ps. 4:4; 19:14; 119:15; Rom. 12:2; Col. 3:1f).

...

To prepare myself as a Christian psychiatrist, I undertook college studies, an M.S. degree in human physiology, an M.D. from medical school, psychiatric residency training in two different programs, and theological course ware from two evangelical seminaries. During those years I was equipped with many techniques and shortcuts for bringing human beings relief from anxieties, depression, phobias, fears, insecurities, and other kinds of emotional and physical pain. Among the many tools I learned to use, by far the one that has been most valuable in helping people attain spiritual well-being is Scripture meditation.3

Meditation affects man’s whole being. Another reason is the fact man does not innately contain God’s thoughts and ways. Again Meier writes:

Man is a totally depraved being, possessing selfish and ultimately self-destructive thought patterns and behavior. Show me a natural man, untaught in God’s principles and I’ll show you a natural man who suffers from emotional pain. I’ll show you a man who experiences the guilt and discomfort of a God-vacuum. I’ll show you a man who is unconsciously fighting and struggling for a sense of significance, using worldly ways (e.g., sexual fantasy, materialism, power struggles, and prestige) in a vain attempt to attain significance all of which will fail. The ways of the world bring temporary relief, like bandaids on open flesh wounds, but not ultimate relief from man’s inner awareness of his insignificance apart from God.4",Luke:21:14,Luke:21:14,NA28 with Critical Apparatus and Mounce Parsings,2014-08-17T15:46:56-04:00,2017-03-22T11:10:40-04:00,""

Behold, My servant will prosper,
He will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted.
Just as many were astonished at you, My people,
So His appearance was marred more than any man
And His form more than the sons of men.
Thus He will sprinkle many nations,
Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him;
For what had not been told them they will see,
And what they had not heard they will understand.
The Suffering Servant
Who has believed our message?
And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot,
And like a root out of parched ground;
He has no stately form or majesty
That we should look upon Him,
Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him.
He was despised and forsaken of men,
A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;
And like one from whom men hide their face
He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.
Surely our griefs He Himself bore,
And our sorrows He carried;
Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken,
Smitten of God, and afflicted.
But He was pierced through for our transgressions,
He was crushed for our iniquities;
The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
And by His scourging we are healed.
All of us like sheep have gone astray,
Each of us has turned to his own way;
But the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all
To fall on Him.
He was oppressed and He was afflicted,
Yet He did not open His mouth;
Like a lamb that is led to slaughter,
And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers,
So He did not open His mouth.
By oppression and judgment He was taken away;
And as for His generation, who considered
That He was cut off out of the land of the living
For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due?
His grave was assigned with wicked men,
Yet He was with a rich man in His death,
Because He had done no violence,
Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.
But the Lord was pleased
To crush Him, putting Him to grief;
If He would render Himself as a guilt offering,
He will see His offspring,
He will prolong His days,
And the good pleasure of the Lord will prosper in His hand.
As a result of the anguish of His soul,
He will see it and be satisfied;
By His knowledge the Righteous One,
My Servant, will justify the many,
As He will bear their iniquities.
Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great,
And He will divide the booty with the strong;
Because He poured out Himself to death,
And was numbered with the transgressors;
Yet He Himself bore the sin of many,
And interceded for the transgressors.",Isaiah:52:13,Isaiah:53:12,NASB Strong's Bible Text (Lockman Edition),2016-02-20T12:51:32-05:00,2016-02-20T12:51:33-05:00,""

is used for ""vindication"" in legal contexts (see, e.g., Job 6:29), for ""deliverance"" or ""salvation"" in exilic contexts (see, e.g., Isa 58:8), and in the sense of ruling, judging with ""justice"" (see, e.g., Lev 19:15; Isa 32:1). Here it probably sums up the justice that the Lord provides through raising up this ruler as well as the safety, security, and well-being that result (see vv. 5-6a). In the NT this takes on soteriological connotations (see 1 Cor 1:31 in its context).

Other Protestantism
In many Protestant churches, the word saint is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian. This is similar in usage to Paul's numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. In this sense, anyone who is within the Body of Christ (i.e., a professing Christian) is a saint because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider intercessory prayers to the saints to be idolatry, since what they perceive to be an application of divine worship that should be given only to God himself is being given to other believers, dead or alive.

Within some Protestant traditions, saint is also used to refer to any born-again Christian. Many emphasize the traditional New Testament meaning of the word, preferring to write ""saint"" to refer to any believer, in continuity with the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.",Ephesians:1:1,Ephesians:1:1,NASB Strong's Bible Text (Lockman Edition),2023-02-07T09:49:16-05:00,2023-02-07T09:57:08-05:00,""

God is all goodness and the source of it all.  We sin against His creation and His very nature.  We are rebels against the King.

Pulpit commentaries:

https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/tpc/psalms-51.html

Against thee, thee only, have I sinned. Though no sins could be more directly against man than adultery and murder, yet David feels that that aspect of them shrinks away into insignificance, and is as if it were not, when they are viewed in their true and real character, as offences against the majesty of God. Every sin is mainly against God; and the better sort of men always feel this. ""How can I do this great wickedness,"" says Joseph, when tempted by Potiphar's wife, ""and sin against God?"" And so David to Nathan, when he was first rebuked by him, ""I have sinned against the Lord"" (2 Samuel 12:13). And done this evil in thy sight; that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. Clear in the eyes of the world, that is; free from all charge of harshness or injustice, when thou judgest me, and condemnest me for my sins, as thou must do.",Psalms:51:4,Psalms:51:4,NASB Strong's Bible Text (Lockman Edition),2025-03-17T07:51:37-04:00,2025-03-17T08:08:51-04:00,LORD Almighty
