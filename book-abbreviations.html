  <H1>Abbreviated names for the books of the Bible</H1>

  <p id="context">
    In <b>BibleModel</b> initialization of the class <b>Book</b> reads a database and
    creates a json file named <STRONG>book-abbreviations.json</STRONG>.
  </p>

  <p id="what">
    This page simply reads that in and displays it as a Table.
  <p>

  <h2><b>WARNINGS:</b></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Because of browser security policy this page will fail unless you change your security settings in your
         browser to turn off normal security.  While you should normally have security on to protect yourself,
         this and other html pages inside this project are for debug purposes.  I suggest you have an alternate
         browser for testing this and turn off it's security.  That way you don't accidentally leave your
          working browser vulnerable.   I hope this can be worked around at some point. In Safari, there are developer
          tools which turn on a 'Develop' menu section.  In that menu there is an item 'Developer settings...'.
          In that settings page there is a checkbox for 'Security: Disable local file restrictions'.  With
          that checked then this should work fine.
